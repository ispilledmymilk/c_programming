Hey! This is a repo i created while learning C programming from several sources.
I have divided it into chapters.
Chapters: 
--Chapter 3 = This chapter revolves around Structured Program Development (control, selection statements, pseudocode)
--Chapter 4 = This chapter revolves around Program Control (iteration statements, logical operators, counter controlled iterations)
--Chapter 5 = This chapter revolves around Functions (usage of functions, recursion, math library)
